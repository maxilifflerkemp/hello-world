# hello-world

right, here we go. 
i'm maxi, 25, from germany but currently living the uk.
after majorly fucking up my resume by travelling too much and working shit jobs inbetween - not to mention dropping out of university twice - i kind of started to think this is it for me. i'm just going to be an unskilled failure meandering through life with no passion for anything other than surfing. until the guys from the it department in my company told me i could teach myself how to code without going to university. a few nights after work on w3schools and freecodecamp and i was hooked and here i am. hoping i can learn and contribute in some kind of way. 
thanks for coming to my ted.talk
